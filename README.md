Language Detection Model

***Language Detection Model using Python***
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect the language of a given text using Python. It is implemented using various text processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify text data into different languages.


**Objective**
To develop a robust and efficient language detection model capable of accurately identifying the language of a given text input using Python.


**Tools & Technologies**
 - Python: Core programming language for model development.
 - Jupyter Notebook: Used for development, testing, and analysis.
 - Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
 - Numpy: Used for numerical computations.
 - Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
 - Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): For preprocessing and feature extraction.

**Model Building**
The language detection model was built using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification tasks.
The model was trained on a labeled dataset of text in different languages, with appropriate preprocessing steps to ensure data quality.

**Key Features**
- Detects a variety of languages from the input text.
- Utilizes basic NLP techniques to preprocess and transform textual data.
- Implements several machine learning classifiers for language detection.
- Provides evaluation metrics for model performance.

**Results**
The model achieves high accuracy of 95% in detecting languages from a multilingual dataset. The evaluation shows promising results, making this model suitable for practical applications like text preprocessing for multilingual systems.
